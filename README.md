## Projects

### Telegram Bot for Animal Shelter

One of my notable projects is the creation of a Telegram bot for a Polish animal shelter. This bot, developed using Python and the TelegramBotAPI library, allows for efficient reception, storage, and display of information about animal interventions reported by the police. It serves as a valuable tool for improving communication and streamlining operations.

### GitHub Functional Testing

I have also worked on developing and executing functional tests for the GitHub web application. Leveraging tools like Postman, Selenium, and PyTest, I performed identical tests covering GitHub's API endpoints, user interface, and combined tests. This project enabled me to evaluate the effectiveness of each testing tool for automated testing of GitHub.
